# MuleSoft API Integration Demo
Demonstration of MuleSoft's API integration using Java/Anypoint Platform/Studio
## ▶️ Overview
In This Demo we are utilizing MuleSoft API integration solutions within a development environment  'Visual Studio Code' (VS Code). In this scenario, we'll create a practical use case for integrating with an e-commerce platform sending GET req using Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**⚙️MuleSoft TechStacks**
- Anypoint Platform for Designing API & Runtime deployment.
- Anypoint Studio for building our Mule Flows.
- CloudHub Deployment
  
**📟 Use Case Overview**
web application that integrates with an e-commerce platform to retrieve product data and display it on your website."

**💻Setup and Environment**
Before we dive into the technical details, let's ensure our development environment is ready. *In this fictional example We are using Visual Studio Code (VS Code) with Java Development Kit (JDK) and Node.js.*


**API Eploration**
Explore the API documentation provided by the e-commerce platform. (SHOPYFY) or others. "This documentation defines the endpoints, request/response structures, and authentication methods."


**🗂VS Code File/Folder Structure**
The necessary folders and files for our integration.

**Java Integration**
Now, let's dive into the Java integration. We'll use Java to create a custom component that interacts with the targeted e-commerce API or can be better customized with APIs of your choice.
